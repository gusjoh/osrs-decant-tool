# OSRS Decant tool
A [website]() for calculating profitable trades within [Old School RuneScape (OSRS)](https://oldschool.runescape.com/ "Old School RuneScape's homepage").
## Purpose
The act of [decanting](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Decanting "Read more about decanting on the game's wiki") in OSRS refers to the conversion of certain items (mainly potions) from one size to another. Such items are either split or combined with no real hinderance in regard to costs or how many times such a conversion can be performed.
These factors, combined with the fact that there's an [open market](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange) (some limitations do apply) within the game, enables a player to make money by buying items which have a low per-use cost and decanting them into a more expensive version.
### Example
1. A player purchases 2000 Magic potion(3)'s with an average cost of 45 gold each which totals 90 000 gold.
2. The 2000 Magic potion(3)'s are decanted into their four dose counterpart resulting in 1500 Magic potion(4)'s and 500 empty vials.
3. The 1500 Magic potion(4)'s are sold for 63 gold each for a total of 94 500 gold. 
4. The empty vials are sold for 3 gold each for a total of 1500 gold.
5. The player ends up with 96 000 gold in total, thereby profiting 6000 gold.
